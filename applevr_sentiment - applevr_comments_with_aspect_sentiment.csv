As an Apple hater, who will never give money to that evil company, I have to admit that this tech is amazing. And it may bring 3D movies back! Remember 3D TVs? Yeah, that was a thing 10 years ago and flopped so hard 😂

"@1:18 I don't see that as a good bet, there is little to no incentive for developers to make apps for the VP because 1. it'll cost a huge amount of money 2. The user base will be too small. Combine that with Apple's fees and no developer will see a return on their app. It's the big reason why Netflix etc have opted out. As i understand there are already some higher end VR products out their for developers, I don't see why they would opts for something like this over the greater flexibility offered by non apple products",Negative,0.7162957191,-1
"@21:50
your statement here is so true. All these devices, which pretty much were the predecessors of Apple Vision Pro had this issue, that people were feeling disconnected. 
Why Apple will succeed though, is that we are at this point in time, that people have been disconnected and no longer search for contact. This is why I believe this is different. ANd in ~3-5 years time that this will be have a couple of revisions, more apps and be cheaper and with people becoming more distant , I see why this can succeed.",Neutral,0.9019665122,0
"@23:55 I disagree. Apple would never do that. They would want to sell you both a Macbook and the Apple Vision Pro. That is why Macbooks don't have a touchscreen, they need to sell iPads, and it is why you can't do real work on a Vision Pro, you still need a Macbook, and use the Vision Pro as an extra screen. And I have just recently used a Quest 3 and it can do many of the things the Vision Pro does, and quite well, and as some put it already, you can buy 7 generations of the Quest headsets for the price of a single Vision Pro.",Neutral,0.9494168758,0
"@Mrwhosetheboss Apple's vision pro is a very good tech, why is everyone forgetting about Microsoft's Hololens and hololens 2 which is AR as opposed to VR (shows video feed of the real world) in vision pro.

AR/MR is never going to _really_ takeoff until ""headsets"" are pretty much in a spectacles form factor IMO.

"After owning it also for about 1 month this is my conclusion:

- it exists so developers develop their apps on it on preparation for next ""consumer ready"" glasses instead of headsets

- it's not worth the money except for 3 people: 1. Rich kids who don't care about thounsads of dollars 2. Developers 3. For someone living in tiny space and he can't have home theater or big TV, this will become his go to media device

- Vision Pro problem is that Quest 3 exist, it made Quest 3 become more appealing, the reason this happened is because Vision Pro spent so much time developing their software

- Vision OS is the only thing in Vision Pro that's in a league of it's own, the hardware can be comparable to others but the software it's main selling point for me

- overall XR glasses will replace phones for good in a decade or so, hence Apple want to be the first there",Negative,0.5422247052,-1

"Bill Gates wrote, ""A computer on every desk and in every home"" as far back as 1980 and people thought he was bat shit crazy. I grew up,in the 90’s, in a home with a “computer room”. My siblings and I would take turns playing mine sweeper and solitaire. I remember when everyone in my school started upgrading from flip phones to smart phones. Now each and every single one of us is walking around with legit computers in our pockets that surpasses the combined computing power of all the computers used in the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. Once this technology becomes socially acceptable and more affordable, I strongly believe this will be the norm. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, will be wearing a headset and reality will be subjugated either by vr or ar reality’s. Or Ai Or even better, neuralink + Apple vision contact lenses = matrix vibes.

Just comment on a other viedeo that Apple made the  vision pro to have there toe in it just to get there software locked up and established in there system. So ""android"" (or others) have it (like in the past) much harder to establish standards. The 3d space is 1 thing of that.
It could feel much less lonely if you could go in VR chat etc. That you can't share local 3D spaces or have an option to open ""tabs?"" in a public mode or something is a big leak too.

I’ve noticed like everything else they get used to me wearing it and I just let them know that I can see everything and to let me know if they need anything. the first week or two it did feel very isolating but now not so much though I will say that isolating feature is great when you’re working on it to keep you focused and not being constantly distracted by your phone or other things.",Positive,0.7468580604,1
"Great review …..actually i think you are being quite forgiving and generous in the compromise department - Steve jobs would never have released this Vision Pro in this way….at a push he would have soft launched and let developers get their hands on it - apple are big enough to roll out in that way without the risk of failure ….i think they have miscalculated - trying to push into mainstream for 3500 dollars , heavy , two hours battery , no major USP / Killer app , no improvement in productivity - seemingly watching Apple TV movie experience is the standout for consumers - and sorry that’s just NOT ENOUGH to create a knock out - especially when Meta have a 500 dollar headset with mainstream appeal - remember that reference to IPhone launch - when it took 3 big features email internet and cell - and made the mobile killer product launch - Steve Jobs would have INSISTED they need to do something similar if they wana succeed with this - the fanboy apologists will run outa steam within weeks - this is a product launch FAIL for someone as big as Apple - they need to own that and respond - and they should pay attention to some of the mainstream concerns you raised here - people are attached and engaged with mobile devices - if they want a killer product to really work - they should at the very least have had a more seamless /improved way of using iPhone - instead iPhone is better at so many things and poor to try read when wearing a Vision Pro that Steve Jobs would have given the engineer s list of 3500 things to fix before bringing to market.

One exception is passthrough since the AVP has better passthrough, but that's not going to be enough to even get marketshare. The video states that Apple is trying to become the default platform but fails to mention that Meta/Oculus has already become the default platform. Today, anything made for VR or AR is available on the Meta/Oculus store and most VR/AR products are designed around these headsets.

In it's current state, the only thing that could make the AVP competitive with other products is the fame effect that Apple products seem to have. But I personally don't think it's going to be enough to make it the ""default platform"".

They wanted to get the framework of it out to devs so that in a few years from now, they can put out a smaller, lighter, cheaper version that normal people can afford, then they will have years of users data and feedback plus a huge library of apps.

If there was a good MMORPG game world I would want to live there.  This is really addictive.  Furthermore... add social credit score or just simple in game purchase boundaries and you could be seduced into behaving, complying, and spending lots of money.  It is very seductive and it is the future.  It is dangerous... that is... lots of people will be seduced in using this virtual portal for hours and hours and it is much better than drugs, real life.  Hook up some joy toys and haptics and you are gonna own people.  We are so close to this...even without having the other 3 senses.  

The main problem for me is that it does not have anything that is constructive or useful in it.   If I could have multiple virtualized desktops.... I probably would be trapped in that thing.  That is I would have all my work just a head tilt and double tap away I would just sit there immersed in my day to day for hours upon hours.  The movies and games do not satisfy me.

"I own the Apple Vision Pro, and I've been deeply immersed in VR for years. While it's an impressive headset, I find myself gravitating towards my Quest 3 more, especially for gaming. If I'm in the mood for high-end PCVR, such as SIm racing or Sim Flights, I lean towards my Varjo XR4 Focal Edition. The issue with the Apple Vision Pro, in my opinion, is that it falls short in certain aspects. It introduces some cool features but doesn't excel to the extent that would make me prioritize it over my other headsets. Additionally, I'm not a huge Apple fan. The Varjo XR4 Focal Edition has somewhat spoiled me due to its superior display—far surpassing the Apple Vision Pro. However, it comes at a significantly higher cost, €12,489, making it more of a niche product for serious VR enthusiasts and businesses who can afford the investment.

"I still don't really accept the idea of it being a great device for media. The thing costs $3500 while even the best TVs tend to peak at the $2000 bracket. But a real TV can be shared with other while this is only for you and you alone. Not to mention that while the displays are good, it can never compete with a real display. That's because while it's basically a 4K display, well if the image doesn't take up the full view, you have an objectively lower res video. 

In fact it's a nonstandard resolution as well so it also has more scaling issues. This is also perpetual as you getting closer or farther from the image means it needs to be constantly rescaling adding more processing. Plus the image image will always be dimmer than a real display. The lenses used to allow us to view a display so close to our eyes basically sap away the brightness so while the display may be rated at over 2000 nits from Sony, it only gives about 150-200 to your eyes.

One thing seems obvious to me also, in order for the audience to spend more than 2K on a headset like this, Apple needs to open up the possibilities for devs , and not do what they did on IOS and Ipad OS ... Ipad OS could be boosted dramatically if we could launch 3rd party App stores , or apps from the web ...

He straight up said the same thing, this prpduct is not necessarily intented to be purchased by the general pubilc. The high upfront cost is to cover the cost of R&D from working on this since 2011. Apple is intending this device to be made successful by the developers.

The same with this apple VR Headset, is it cool? Yes, is it pratical? not so much. I think that there are a lot of things that could be better on VR, but I'm willing to bet, its more on the professional side, such as engineers and ppl who really need more monitors than its phyiscally possible. Plus the good thing about technology is that IT HELPS OUR LIVES, I love my phone because of that, but at the end of the day, if I dont want to be bother by it, it just needs to be put on my pocket and on silence mode. That VR is huge, and even if it was able to hold a days worth of battery, its not something that I personally would carry.

"People keep banging on about the price as if it's actually significant, in the grand scheme of things, or but more specifically, significant for apple.

They sell a $5000 display, and the stand for that display, sold separately is another $1000. They sell $2000+ smart phones and tablets, $5000 mini PC's and laptops, $1000 smart watches, all with overlapping features, all that work together seamlessly all but demanding that you buy them all! There whole gimmick is ""luxury"" and ""quality"" which is only proven out by ridiculous prices. 

And they've been doing it for 40 years. 

The Apple Lisa, launched in 1983. For $10,000. That's not the inflation adjusted price. That's 10,000 1983 dollars (inflation adjusted that comes to a tad over $31,000) 

It wasn't meant to succeed, it was meant to show the world what computers could and should be. GUI, text to speech, mouse, the fonts...it was a tech demo, that you could buy. Yes, most of those features were stolen from xerox,  but xerox didn't package them into an appliance any idiot could use. 

Apple spent $100 billion developing the vision pro, with only about $20 billion of that being on the actual hardware...and after more than a decade of VR and AR headsets filled with compromises, quirks and limitations, Apple has once again showed the world what a product could and should be.  

It doesn't matter if there's a legitimate need for it NOW, there will be, and every competitor is going to be playing catch up for the next 5 years trying to release something half as good as the thing that's 5 years old.

Which means, much like iphone, and ipad....that's where the developers will go, and that's where consumers will flock...and realistically there's only a few companies that could dump the required money into developing a competing product: 
Microsoft, who already tried, and mostly failed outside of limited corporate use.
Google, who has their fingers in so many pies, which they usually abandon before even tasting. 
Nvidia, who simply doesn't need to. They've already cornered the AI market and have made it fairly clear that consumer tech is now beneath them. 

Oculus had potential before facebook bought them out, but zuck is more interested with creating a VR social platform that no one asked for or cares about.

Computers and smartphones are good examples of this. What does this gadget do that's so revolutionary? Nothing, everything I can do on a computer or smartphone I can do on this and probably more efficiently as well. 

I guess the form-factor is the selling point, unfortunately it's far from ideal and very expensive. In this economic environment you're just not gonna get mass adoption unless you provide tangible benefits people really can't get elsewhere. 

At best this is like their smartwatch that nobody asked for, that's there for some people to waste money on.

Also, the biggest flaw of the vision pro, other than the field of view, is the reliance on AirPods pro for personal sound. The airpods really suck at cancelling sound. They simultaneously fail to cancel voices and heavy noise and they also have to high pressure impact from the cancellation. $90 in ears do a much better job of both eliminating ambience, and providing quality sound.

"This technology is interesting, and I can imagine a lot of innovation and improved productivity in specific cases.  For personal use, I would ban it!  Recording the eyes and their tracking movements and pupil dilation are subconscious indicators.  These could be used to analyze our preferences, pleasures and interests from objects to sexual partners and actions.  Even if we do nothing in the physical world and just think that a person is attractive, we could be arrested, because of the elaborate standard that society wants to enforce.  Not to mention the commercials and product offers, because of our opinion it looks interesting.  You haven't even touched the security of biometric data.  Including a recording of a fingerprint, a recording of a speech, a recording of an eyeball, in Apple's world, they can erase our identity in the real world because they have everything they need.  We never allow one system to have total control, because in the end we can lose it too.",Negative,0.5814780593,-1

"This video smells of 'sponsored by Apple'. It does nothing that cant already be done on a quest3. Sure it might do spacial tracking better, and have more 2D screens at once, but who really wants that.
Also, there is an app on Quest called fluid, which shows the Quest is capable of better 2D screen viewing, so its only a matter of time before meta build it in as standard.

3:12 i disagree. Its not a video call if its not a direct video of you.
CGI, filters and AI enhancements are artificial, and if I was a ceo, I would never except it in a conference.

Like you pointed out, I would never want my employees lazing in bed while attending to work.

Its only time before they can drift off to sleep and have a AI display their facial expresions.

7:30 you know this isnt the first headset to allow you to select things with your eyes. Even psvr2 does it. Dont act like Apple have brought anything new to the table. Theyve done what they always do, which is take stuff that is already available at reasonable costs. Spend years refining it making it look premium without actually adding anything new, then charge a huge amount for it.
Mark my words, all other manufacturers will eventually think its ok to charge £3k because apple got away with it. And everyone will think apple created MR/AR/VR just like they think they did the smart phone.

13:42. This is not a good thing. It becomes an issue long before someone tried to use something non apple. You are forced to over spend on simple things like chargers. When Im buying gadgets, I spend a lot of time researching the best thing for me for the best price. I am not being herded into an apple only eco system.
The two most important factors in buying is choice and price. Apple lose at both of these every time.",Negative,0.7744498253,-1

"Very much liked your review. Interesting perspectives and balanced. 
Apple is probably also, apart from stirring up developers, testing the waters to see in what scenarios people use it most: office use, outdoor/travelling scenarios, ...). 

What I however think I -- or you(r team)-- missed is the screen duplication. I believe other reviewers say that the vision pro, connected to steam vr on a Microsoft machine, can do multiple screens. This is for professional use very exciting as it is the best vr display around. Being able to zone out of any office environment with multiple virtual screens is very appealing to me (unlike the rest of the use cases), here I want complete and utter focus and no distractions while still being physically 'reachable' by people. In the review it says it isn't as sharp as another screen, but, after reviewing the bit several times this is, compared to the best around. Well most dual set-ups in an office also pale to the best around...",Positive,0.6579012871,1

"While I do agree with most of the review, I can't agree in general with the loneliness part. Apple Vision Pro is very lonely experience, yes. But it is not the rule for all headsets and it is possible to be changed for the Apple's one too. Quest's ecosystem for example is very social, you can teleport to other user virtual room, straight in the main environment\home screen. You have 3d representation, positional audio from each of your online friends. While yes, I'm talking about online, not offline mode. In offline it is more like a party toy, that's all. At least it is easier to have fun in parties to play some games or fun experience, than try to show off work environment or high res movie in Apple Vision Pro. Sometimes we play golf on one headset, passing it around between people

And I want to add-  for online things it is more connecting than webcams or regular gaming. You feel the presence of another person. That's unique feeling. While I've never tried Apple Vision Pro, it seems like their facetime doesn't scratch that niche. Right now Apple Vision Pro doesn't add social value to people.

"Who is in charge of how YouTube works on the Apple Vision Pro? Is that Apple's doing, or is that Google's?  (Hint: apps owned by other companies are not made by Apple)

It makes sense to me that Google would want to limit how their product is used on competing hardware products, so that you'll want their product, instead (while Google Glass may have failed because it was way ahead of its time, modifications based on the success of the Apple Vision Pro would allow Google to create a competing product based on their previous iterations with new modifications; therefore, Google no surprise that Google limited their software on hardware they think could be eventual competition).

That being said, I really appreciate this thorough review of the product. I think you hit the nail on the head in that this product is designed to excite people for a 2nd generation product that solves the bigger issues over the next couple of years through research and development that was funded by the first generation product.",Neutral,0.8500619531,0

"You hit the nail on the head with that ""you do what Apple will let you do"" part, and I feel like Meta has a similar issue - and it's holding both of them back!
Imagine if the internet never had been a network of random computers that use open protocols to talk to each other. We'd have something like ""CompuServe"", where the internet was exactly what one company envisioned it to be, with no browser competition (we used to have that...), no thousands of start-ups and private citizens sharing their ideas in the same network, mostly independent of each other.
VR and AR need there ""internet"" moment, which simply cannot happen in a walled garden. I have a Quest 3, but the last thing I'd ever use it for is the ""metaverse"". With its limitations, it's just a workout device for me. And both Meta and Apple make it very hard for people who have VR headsets to pull their friends and family into the world of VR.

If you follow the history of iPhone software vs hardware features, Apple always put their new code on the main camera, and won't let you use new features on other cameras until they've evolved to the point at which Apple gives the green light. So they're not just worried about someone saying ""eew, bad ultrawide shot, bro!"" they're worried about any of their cool software tricks getting branded with that.
